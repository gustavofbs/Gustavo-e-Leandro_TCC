	abstract = {Automated testing is vital for ensuring the reliability of web applications. This paper presents a preliminary study on leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) models, specifically ChatGPT and Github Copilot, to generate test scripts for web end-to-end testing. Through experimentation, we evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of AI language models in generating test scripts based on natural language descriptions of user interactions with web applications. Our preliminary results show that AI-based generation generally provides an advantage over fully manual test scripts development. Starting from test cases clearly defined in Gherkin, a reduction in development time is always observable. In some cases, this reduction is statistically significant (e.g., Manual vs. a particular use of ChatGPT). These results are valid provided that the tester has some skills in manual test script development and is therefore able to modify the code produced by the AI-generation tools. This study contributes to the exploration of AI-driven solutions in web test scripts generation and lays the foundation for future research in this domain.},

abstract = {In software development, the raw requirements proposed by users are frequently incomplete, which impedes the complete implementation of software functionalities. With the emergence of large language models, the exploration of generating software through user requirements has attracted attention. Recent methods with the top-down waterfall model employ a questioning approach for requirement completion, attempting to explore further user requirements. However, users, constrained by their domain knowledge, result in a lack of effective acceptance criteria during the requirement completion, failing to fully capture the implicit needs of the user. Moreover, the cumulative errors of the waterfall model can lead to discrepancies between the generated code and user requirements. The Agile methodologies reduce cumulative errors of the waterfall model through lightweight iteration and collaboration with users, but the challenge lies in ensuring semantic consistency between user requirements and the code generated by the agent. To address these challenges, we propose AgileGen, an agile-based generative software development through human-AI teamwork. Unlike existing questioning agents, AgileGen adopts a novel collaborative approach that breaks free from the constraints of domain knowledge by initiating the end-user perspective to complete the acceptance criteria. By introducing the Gherkin language, AgileGen attempts for the first time to use testable requirement descriptions as a bridge for semantic consistency between requirements and code, aiming to ensure that software products meet actual user requirements by defining user scenarios that include acceptance criteria. Additionally, we innovate in the human-AI teamwork model, allowing users to participate in decision-making processes they do well and significantly enhancing the completeness of software functionality. To ensure semantic consistency between requirements and generated code, we derive consistency factors from Gherkin to drive the subsequent software code generation. Finally, to improve the reliability of user scenarios, we also introduce a memory pool mechanism, collecting user decision-making scenarios and recommending them to new users with similar requirements. AgileGen, as a user-friendly interactive system, significantly outperformed existing best methods by 16.4\% and garnered higher user satisfaction.},

abstract = {In Agile software development methodology, a user story describes a new feature or functionality from an end user's perspective. The user story details may also incorporate acceptance testing criteria, which can be developed through negotiation with users. When creating stories from user feedback, the software engineer may maximize their usefulness by considering story attributes, including scope, independence, negotiability, and testability. This study investigates how LLMs (large language models), with guided instructions, affect undergraduate software engineering students' ability to transform user feedback into user stories. Students, working individually, were asked to analyze user feedback comments, appropriately group related items, and create user stories following the principles of INVEST, a framework for assessing user stories. We found that LLMs help students develop valuable stories with well-defined acceptance criteria. However, students tend to perform better without LLMs when creating user stories with an appropriate scope.},

abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is transforming software development processes, including test and evaluation (T&E). From automating test case design to enabling continuous testing in DevOps pipelines, AI-driven tools enhance the efficiency, accuracy, and speed of software testing. At the same time, the integration of AI components into software-reliant systems introduces new challenges for verification and validation (V&V). Traditional T&E methodologies must evolve to address issues such as AI bias, hallucinated outputs, and the complexity of validating non-deterministic behaviors. This position paper examines how existing T&E methods must evolve to account for AI's stochastic nature, and conversely how GenAI is transforming T&E practices across the software development lifecycle (SDLC).},
